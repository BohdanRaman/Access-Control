/**
 * Exercise 8:Following the form of the example Lunch.java, create a class called
 * ConnectionManager that manages a fixed array of Connection objects. The client
 * programmer must not be able to explicitly create Connection objects, but can only get them
 * via a static method in ConnectionManager. When the ConnectionManager runs out of
 * objects, it returns a null reference. Test the classes in main( ).
